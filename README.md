# Habit tracker app!

A minimalistic habit tracking app! This application allows its users to enter habits and track them. User can also edit entered habits and delete them. If user wants to stop habit tracking he can stop it and then that habit is only seen on past days. User cant track habits in the future. Habit tracking is shown in form of checking the habit for that day.

## Features

- View habits day by day
- Day navigation
- Add, edit, delete and stop habit tracking

# Future imporovments

In the future I would like to add habit tracking completion for the selected duration. It would appear near each habit as a progress line that would update whenever user ticks the habit for a day. If the duration is selected for a week then during 7 days the bar of completion would fill with color so each day user ticks the habit as completed he could see the bar filling at the end of duration the user could add notes under that bar of completion how did it go for user. Also depending on completion % I would like to add messages in the bar to say stuff like "keep going" or "you can do it!". Also it would be nice to play animation when user completes habit for selected duration.
